## Definition of Machine Learning
- Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine Learning is the field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn **without being explicitly programmed**
- Tom Mitchell (1998): a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
  - experience = data

## Taxonomy of Machine Learning(Simplistic View Based on Tasks)
- Supervised Learning
  - given: a dataset that contains $n$ samples ($n$ pairs of ($x, y$))
  - task: if a residence has $x$ square feet, predict its price $y$?
    - $x$ can be more than one dimensional ex) [$x_1, x_2$]
  - "Supervision" refers to output $y$'s
  - Regrssion vs Classification
    - regression: if $y \in \R$ is a continuous variable
    - classification: the label $y$ is a discrete variable
- Unsupervised Learning
  - dataset contains **no labels**: no correct answer is given
  - Clustering
  - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
  - Word Embeddings
    - represent words by vectors
    - word $-encode\rightarrow$ vector
    - relation $-encode\rightarrow$ direction
  - Clustering Words with Similar Meanings (Hierarchically)
  - Large Language Models
- Reinforcement Learning
  - learning to make sequential decisions
  - the algorithm can collect data interactively
    - try the startegy and collect feedbacks $\lrarr$ improve the startegy based on the feedbacks
